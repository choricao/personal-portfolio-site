          <h2>Dissecting Tech Interviews</h2>
          <h3>November 1, 2018</h3>
          <p>Today's topic is about what you can expect after getting an invitation to officially start your interview process with a company for a software engineering position. The process really depends on which company you are interviewing with, but usually it involves a couple of standard components, including 1) a screening interview with a technical recruiter over the phone, 2) a take-home challenge in a particular form, 3) a screening interview with a decision maker over the phone or onsite, and 4) an onsite interview with a couple of future coworkers involved. So far, I have seen combinations of 1-2-3-4, 1-3-2-4, 1-2-4, and 2-3-(1)-4. And don't be surprised if you have another type of interview not listed here. Just be open-minded and get prepared the best you can. Also there might another person involved in this process, the interview coordinator. This person can be the technical recruiter you talk to, can also be another person who just takes care of all interviews for that position. You should probably contact this person regarding interview progress. Now let's go to details about each one. </p>
          <h4>~~ Talking to A Technical Recruiter ~~</h4>
          <p>This is definitely a two-way converstation. The recruiter probably will ask you about how much you know about the company and why you apply. Don't worry if you don't really understand their business. Do a brief research, and be honest about what you know. But you definitely should show your passion. If you feel you need fake on that, rethink about if you should apply. You should only apply for the companies that you have at least a neutral impression. I won't sugguest you waste your time on companies you don't want to work for. This is also the best time to ask any questions about the company's products and finicial status, especially for small and mid-size companies. Also the structure of their organization. The technical recruiter may not be able to answer technical questions, but they should be quite familiar with the big picture of the company, like how well the company is doing and their plan to expand the team. I just covered a couple of topics I usually ask. You should come up with your own list before the conversation.</p>
          <p>In term of your background, you should be comfortable to explain your projects to a non-engineering person, and why you think you are a good fit for this position. Also, visa sponsorship is something foreign candidates may need, so the recruiter probably will ask about this for a doublecheck.</p>
          <p>I usually spend about 0.5 - 1 hour to prepare for this interview. I will learn a little bit about the company. I may download and try their products if it's a mobile app. Then I will compare my resume with the job description, and make sure to highlight my relevant skills, and prepare questions based on this whole process.</p>
          <p>The recruiter may wrap up the conversation with some information about the next step. If this is not provided, you probably should ask to get some idea about their timeline. Usually the whole hiring process takes about 3 - 4 weeks. It makes sense if you think about the four steps I mentioned early. But this is also company-specific. Since I am targeting at small and mid-size companies right now, my experiences is more representative of this group.</p>
          <h4>~~ Take-home Challenge ~~</h4>
          <p>So far I have encountered three types of challenge questions: 1) timed online problem, 2) timed offline problem, and 3) untimed offline design question. I would suggest different strategies for each one of them. But general rules would apply to all of them, like having a good editor with debugging capability ready especially for 1 & 2, solving problems step by step, and saving your work gradually. Now let's look into them in more details.</p>
          <h5>1. Timed Online Problem</h5>
          <p>A popular platform for this type of problem is HackerRank. You are supposed to solve one or more problems within a time limit, usually a couple of hours. There will be description of the problem, some sample inputs and outputs, requirements, and tests. You might be able to download the samples to your local machine. There is be an editor where you choose your perferred language and input your code. If you haven't tried any of these platforms before, I highly recommend you try the <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/tests/sample" class="link">sample test</a> on HankerRank to get familiar with the UI, therefore you don't waste anytime on getting familiar with the environment when you do your real test. This can also prevent your from getting panic if you cannot figure out how it works during a real test.</p>
          <p>In terms of the answer, you usually know how many tests you pass after clicking Run Code button. You may need to pass all of the known tests (sample inputs & outputs) to get additional test being ran. For the additional ones, there may not be any clue why you fail, so you need to figure out what are the cases have not been covered by your current code. This can be frustrating. Try your best to debug, but don't worry if you cannot finish it. My personal experience indicates that passing all test cases is not the only way you get into next round. So just calm down, and do your best. Usually you can submit as many times as you want within the time limit. So I usually submit whenever I make some substantial progress, like passing most of the initial tests. I will submit again once I pass another one.</p>
          <p>Once you finish the problem, give yourself a break and don't think about the problem for now. But <strong>do remember to save your code in a file</strong>, so that if you make it through, you can revisit your answer, and prepare for any questions about improvement of your code in your next interview. Challenge questions are intimitating, but keep in mind that it may not be the only criteria during the hiring process. You just need to show your hard work and the way you tackle a problem. Don't worry about things you cannot control. Actually I have my personal philosophy about whiteboarding/coding challenges: if I am evaluated just by this type of exercise, I may not want to work at that company at all. I am a human, not a machine. You may not agree with me on this, and it's totally ok. If this is the only way you can get into your dream company, then working hard definitely increases your chance. No matter what, good luck!</p>
          <h5>2. Timed Offline Problem</h5>
          <p>For the problem I did, two links were provided in the email: problem link and submission link. I was tracked when I opened the problem link, that's when the timer started. So basically I was supposed to submit my solution to the other link within the time limit, 2 hours in this case.</p>
          <p>The problem can be just text. There won't be an IDE for you to write and test your code. That said, you will need to create your own file(s), create and use your own test cases, and write necessary instructions about how to run and test your code (because your perferred language might be new to your reviewer). I use Ruby for code challenges, so I actually wrote an instruction based on Ada's Jump Start Environment Setup. I also recommended <a href="https://repl.it/" class="link">repl.it</a>, because it's actually very convenient to use for this situation. I wrote tests for all cases I could think of after the method, but I didn't have time to create a test file for that. I think it would be great to write automatic tests to show your TDD skills, but it might not be practical given the time constraint.</p>
          <p>My advice for this type of problem: read through the email, and get prepared for things you can do in advance, like writing a draft instruction for installations, and maybe creating a testing template if you want to have automatic tests in your solution. To make sure they do get my solution, I actually attached my solution again when I updated my status via email... I don't think it's necessary, but it's a 4.2KB file anyway 😅</p>
          <h5>3. Untimed Offline Design Question</h5>
          <p>I acutally don't know how often this type of questions are given for interviews. My personal impression is: the jobseeker must be quite familiar with the tools being used by the team, and the questions need to be solved with these tools. So not like general challenge questions, you may be limited to use one particular language or framework, and you probably should have implemented similar projects before. So your experiences probably match the position very well.</p>
          <p>In my case, I was asked to implement a couple of simple features for an app. Code base with vague outline codes and a couple of TO-DO stubs were provided. It's a quite open project, so there is no hard deadline and detailed requirements, although I was recommended to finished within a week. I basically tackled the problem like what I did at Ada. Created an ERD first, then filled out the TO-DOs by category, wrote test stubs as needed, implemented required functions, finally cleaned up the code. Since a funtional app was not required, I didn't really try to make it work. I did mannualy test a private helper method which was not covered by the test suite to make sure it actually works as intended. As usual, I used git for version control.</p>
          <p>I added notes in the email when I sent the answer back, and was told my work will be reviewed within a week. I am still waiting for the response, so not sure if my work is good enough to pass the test. I will update here once I get an answer for that. Figure crossed. 🙏</p>
          <p><strong>Update: </strong>I got a response regarding my onsite interview with the team. It seems my approach was good enough for this type of task. And it's ok to just write test stubs for this project. 😌</p>
          <h4>~~ Talking to Hiring Manager/Someone Important ~~</h4>
          <p>Although you can get some insight about the position from recruiter, this is the perfect time to learn about what the team does and uses, and if the position actually aligns well with your interest. You may talk to the hiring manager, or a senior engineer in that team, who is supposed to be able to answer most of your technical questions. They are also the person who will decide if you should be invited for a onsite interview conducted by a group of people, probably your future coworkers and collaborators.</p>
          <p>Usually this is another round of phone interview. But sometimes it can be done onsite if you are local and would like to visit their office. I would recommend to go in person if it's an option, because I see many benefits doing it. You can learn more about their culture and working environment. You will talk to a person face to face, which I think is easier for communication than a phone call. If you make it to the real onsite, you already know how to get there and won't get lost. 😅 Anyway, I had very positive experience for one of my prior-onsite onsite interview.</p>
          <p>To prepare for this type of interview, make sure you can explain your projects very well. They are the people who can understand what you have done and raise questions about implementations, even when they are not quite familiar with the specific technologies you use. If you're still learning something, then be honest about that, and express your passion about learning more. Be confident and show you hard work as well. Based on my experiences, being curious and self-motivated are two important qualifications managers are looking for in software engineering candidates.</p>
          <p>In terms of your own questions, anything you care about for your next job, and maybe some technical questions. I usually ask about terms I cannot understand on the job description. Sometimes I can find the answer online, but I like to listen to my interviewer's answer, because I can get an idea about their personality based on this conversation. Usually it's a also a good reflection of the company's culture. I would say, this might be the best opportunity to learn about your future boss (may not be your manager), who definitely will have a great impact on your life if you get hired. So make sure you have a positive feeling about this interview when you make your final decision.</p>
          <h4>~~ Finally, the Onsite ~~</h4>

          <h2>Job Search Strategies</h2>
          <h3>October 31, 2018</h3>
          <p>Happy Halloween! 👻 After two weeks of job search, I finally get a chance to share my experiences here. Actually everything is going so well. I have 6 active interviews at different stages, and 3 to start in the near future. Job market is pretty good. Today's journal will focus on resume, LinkedIn, referral, and schedule. I will share my interview experiences in the next journal.</p>
          <h4>Resume 📝</h4>
          <p>Last time when I searched for a job, I used MS Word to write resumes. Since job seekers are always recommended to customize their resume for each position, I still remember the large number of similar but different files I had back then. I have to say it wasn't easy to keep track of them.</p>
          <p>This time, I changed my strategy. First, I switched to Google Docs. I picked one of their resume template, so I didn't need to worry about styling. Then I had one base resume, which basically contained everything I need in a general purpose resume: Title (name, phone, email, and links), Summary, Experiences, Community Engagement, and Education. So whenever I want to update my resume, I change content is this base version. And when I am ready to apply for a new position, I will make a copy of this file, change the file name to include company's name, and add another session below Summary: Top Relevant Skills. This session will be a list of the experiences/skills relevant to that particular position, like a highlighter. I can download the file as pdf, or I can simply share my link with recruiters. The advantage of sharing a file is you can update your resume after submitting your application, then whoever look at the file will be able to see the updated version as well. Super convenient! So far, this new strategy worked pretty well.</p>
          <h4>LinkedIn 👩🏻‍💻</h4>
          <p>LinkedIn is very important. It's one of the best ways to find connections. Although some people may not feel comfortable to connect with "strangers", there are many people out there who would like to offer help. Also it's a great place to build your own profile, show your hard work, and express your opinions. I think I finally figure out how to make LinkedIn work for me. And I actually got one of my interviews through LinkedIn.</p>
          <h4>Referral 🤝</h4>
          <p>Based on my experiences, application by referral is the best way to get into the door. I submitted a couple of applications online directly. I have only seen rejection email or no response so far. On the other hand, I got response for almost all of my applications with a referral. And for the ones with a response, I started the official interview process pretty soon, usually within a week. The fastest one was within one business day. I am glad I went to a great meetup during class session. I got most of the current interviews because of help from people in that group. ❤️</p>
          <h4>Schedule 📆</h4>
          <p>Since I am doing a full-time internship, I have very limited time for interviews. A good shedule strategy is another thing I need to think about. I chose to WFH on Monday and Friday to take phone interviews, then Tuesday through Thursday for onsite interviews when I am in the town. For phone interview, I am using Google voice. I usually have 2 - 3 interviews and probably 1 - 2 take-home challenges per week. I will do challenges during weekend, when I have a large block of time. So far, everything goes quite smoothly. I don't have much stress since I spread everything throughout the week, so I will just focus on one thing at a time.</p>

          <h2>R Package 📦</h2>
          <h3>October 7, 2018</h3>
          <p>I wrote my first R Package two weeks ago. With the right references, the process was pretty smooth. Here are the tutorial (<a href="https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/packaging-shiny-applications-a-deep-dive" class="link">Packaging Shiny Applications: A Deep Dive by Mango Solutions</a>) and book (<a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/" class="link">R Packages by Hadley Wickham</a>) I followed. The deployment part was a little tricky. I wasn't a sudoer when I deployed it the first time to our internal server, so it was done with my coworker's help. Still, I was proud of myself, since I am a new R coder and Linux user. 😎</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Docker 🐳</h2>
          <h3>September 22, 2018</h3>
          <p>After one and a half months of R learning, I finally started my Docker journey one week ago. By following this tutorial: <a href="https://www.bjoern-hartmann.de/post/learn-how-to-dockerize-a-shinyapp-in-7-steps/" class="link">Learn How To Dockerize A Shiny App in 7 Steps</a>, I was able to dockerize my Shiny app within one day, and ran it on both Windows 10 and Mac. There are still many areas to learn about Docker, especially things about network and security. Also, maybe Kubenetes in one or two months? So excited! 😃</p>
        </li>

          <h2>Internship!</h2>
          <h3>August 7, 2018</h3>
          <p>After having a couple of one-on-one with boss in the past two days, I already learned a lot: my three major projects, an overview of our products, most of the tools we are using, R/Shiny programming, and all possible directions in the future. I am glad that I get the opportunity to learn what I want to learn. Actually Shiny is pretty powerful. Current goal is to replicate a simple version of my capstone project with R Shiny this week. 😎</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Capstone Summary</h2>
          <h3>August 7, 2018</h3>
          <p>Overall, I love React Native and the wonderful packages I used for this project. Expo turned out to be a great tool because I was able to not worry about "build" issues. And its build-standalone-app process was quite easy to follow, at least for Android version. Both Google Maps Direction API and Dark Sky API were easy to use. With some help, I finally deployed a Rails backend to AWS. Flaticon is great if you don't want to draw your own icons. If you do want to DIY, check out Sketch. GCP's $300 credit for 12-month was much better than Azure's $200 credit for 1-month. My laptop broke in the middle of the project. Well, good thing is Apple Care changed the logic board, top and bottom covers. So right before internship, I kinda got a brand new laptop. 😝</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>We Made It!</h2>
          <h3>June 10, 2018</h3>
          <p>Last week might be the only week in my life filled with 6 interviews with 6 different companies. I made it as every C9 Adies did. To me, it wasn't bad at all. I got to take two days off with no homework. I even felt kinda empty on the second day 😅 Interviews went well. Turned out the teams I didn't put on my list were also great. It actually might be hard to come up with my final list now. Two more weeks on React and two more weeks until internship placement announcement. I am so excited about exploring more in my internship. 😇</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Just Want To Write These Down :p</h2>
          <h3>June 2, 2018</h3>
          <p>Although this page is supposed to be hosting CODE journals, I really feel the urge to write down what happened last week. And since the class session is almost done, I probably will keep updating this page from now on! 😁 Hopefully I will share more technical stuffs here during capstone and internship.</p>
          <p>#1. Solar System</p>
          <p>Our first weekend project at Ada was to build a CLI program that displays information about the Solar System. That Sunday, my older daughter went to the library with daddy and brought some books back as usual. What surprised me was that one of the books was "Solar System". Last Wednesday, when I picked her up, one of her art works was the Solar System with colorful drawing and almost-right name for each planet in the right order. You can definitely tell which one is 🌍. Time flies so fast. While I was learning to be a developer at Ada, she also learned so many things. I miss the time I spent with her exclusively. I miss the time I spent with her and her sister together. But I know what I am doing now is to make sure I can spend more time with them even more happily in the future. And I know that day is not far. ❤️</p>
          <p>#2. Small World</p>
          <p>I accidentally found out that one of my friends moved to my area recently. I don't remember how she showed up on my LinkedIn page, because we connected a couple of years ago and both of us are not active on LinkedIn. Anyway, we talked a little, and she said she is actively looking for a job in industry and will have an interview the next day in Austin (the other city where we both stayed several years ago). Since I know how hard it can be to switch from academia to industry, I really wanted to help her to connect with people in the field. And I do know some people now. The next day, I saw Indeed's people at Ada, having on-campus interviews with C8 Adies. So I talked to their HR, whom I got to know several month ago at Ada. He was very nice and offering to be a connection. What makes this story a story is: that night, my friend told me that the company she just interviewed with was Indeed. What a small world! 😅</p>
          <p>#3. Another Coincidence</p>
          <p>On Thursday, I woke up early again... So I had no energy to work when I got to Ada at 7:30. I decided to treat myself with web surfing. I searched for Meetup because I was going to one the next morning. Then I learned that Meetup is actually a company, which was acquired by another company called WeWork last year. Then I started to learn what WeWork does. Then I searched for WeWork facilities nearby on Google maps... I definitely got what I wanted: relax. And learned some new things about the industry as a bonus. What makes this story a story is what happened in the afternoon... A couple of my classmates and I visited one of our sponsor companies as planned. We knew it's a startup, but what surprised me was that the place we were going was one of the WeWork facilities from my search results in the morning. 🤣</p>
          <p>#4. A Great Meetup</p>
          <p>After a crazy April, I finally was able to continue attending the only meetup that I can attend - Seattle CoffeeOps (Dev+Ops) at Chef Software, Inc. The topics were great this time, and I learned a lot about Cloud and Dev-Ops through the discussion. I shared some of my experiences and opinions on diversity and group work. I got to know many fantastic people and Coda! So I will keep going as long as my schedule allows. Also looking forward to LunchOps. 😋</p>
          <p>Overall, it's been a great week with so many surprises. Looking forward to more from the interview week! 😎</p>

          <h2>I Am Back!</h2>
          <h3>May 5, 2018</h3>
          <p>Since Ada's curriculum is so intense, it's very hard to maintain a site with fresh code journals. I will continue updating my portfolio, but I prabably won't have time for this Code Journal section before the program ends... 😅 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>CSS Grid vs. Flexbox</h2>
          <h3>Mar 17, 2018</h3>
          <p>To me, CSS is like a huge black box. There are so many propertie and value pairs available hiding somewhere. So I was kinda frustrated ☹️ at some point and had a strong feeling 😤 again... It's not because CSS is hard. Compared to CS fundamentals and design problems, I know CSS is much easier to understand. It just confuses me, and I don't have the time to get everything clear. So I gave align-content, align-items, justify-content and justify-items ❓❓❓ during retro.</p>
          <p>I expressed my negative feeling 😠 to my husband after dinner. And he was quite excited 😁 when he heard that. It turned out he was kinda an expert in this area - his previous job was to figure out how to let the browser understand these terms and display the html file properly on the screen. So, with his help, I finally know the difference between align and justify.</p>
          <p>Here is a brief summary: <span class="strong">For Grid, justify is always along the row direction ➡️, and align is always along the column direction ⬇️. For Flexbox, justify is along the flow direction, and align is perpendicular to the flow direction.</span></p>
          <p>I am glad I asked for help again for this particular problem. It saved me a lot of time, so that I can make this site much better.😄 So the moral of this story is: NEVER GIVE UP! If you get stuck and cannot figure it out yourself, look for help. There are so much supports out there. And you may get surprised how much you can learn from others just by a brief conversation. BTW, Happy St. Patrick's Day! 🍀 </p>

          <h2>We Are Doing It!</h2>
          <h3>Mar 17, 2018</h3>
          <p>This is the official first post of this Journal. The past 1.5 month at Ada was amazing. It wasn't easy, but it's AMAZING. (Forgive my so limited and dry English vocabulary...) I learned a lot, not just about coding, but also the amazing people I got to meet and know here. I have to finish my project first, so I will stop here. I may come back and add more later. But before I forget, I want to say: keep going C9. Summer is coming, and we will start our internship very soon. 😄 </p>
