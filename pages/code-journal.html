          <h2>We made it!</h2>
          <h3>June 10, 2018</h3>
          <p>Last week might be the only week in my life filled with 6 interviews with 6 different companies. I made it as every C9 Adies did. To me, it wasn't bad at all. I got to take two days off with no homework. I even felt kinda empty on the second day üòÖ Interviews went well. Turned out the teams I didn't put on my list were also great. It actually might be hard to come up with my final list now. Two more weeks on React and two more weeks until internship placement announcement. I am so excited about exploring more in my internship. üòá</p>

          <h2>Just Want To Write These Down :p</h2>
          <h3>June 2, 2018</h3>
          <p>Although this page is supposed to be hosting CODE journals, I really feel the urge to write down what happened last week. And since the class session is almost done, I probably will keep updating this page from now on! üòÅ Hopefully I will share more technical stuffs here during capstone and internship.</p>
          <p>#1. Solar System</p>
          <p>Our first weekend project at Ada was to build a CLI program that displays information about the Solar System. That Sunday, my older daughter went to the library with daddy and brought some books back as usual. What surprised me was that one of the books was "Solar System". Last Wednesday, when I picked her up, one of her art works was the Solar System with colorful drawing and almost-right name for each planet in the right order. You can definitely tell which one is üåç. Time flies so fast. While I was learning to be a developer at Ada, she also learned so many things. I miss the time I spent with her exclusively. I miss the time I spent with her and her sister together. But I know what I am doing now is to make sure I can spend more time with them even more happily in the future. And I know that day is not far. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
          <p>#2. Small World</p>
          <p>I accidentally found out that one of my friends moved to my area recently. I don't remember how she showed up on my LinkedIn page, because we connected a couple of years ago and both of us are not active on LinkedIn. Anyway, we talked a little, and she said she is actively looking for a job in industry and will have an interview the next day in Austin (the other city where we both stayed several years ago). Since I know how hard it can be to switch from academia to industry, I really wanted to help her to connect with people in the field. And I do know some people now. The next day, I saw Indeed's people at Ada, having on-campus interviews with C8 Adies. So I talked to their HR, whom I got to know several month ago at Ada. He was very nice and offering to be a connection. What makes this story a story is: that night, my friend told me that the company she just interviewed with was Indeed. What a small world! üòÖ</p>
          <p>#3. Another Coincidence</p>
          <p>On Thursday, I woke up early again... So I had no energy to work when I got to Ada at 7:30. I decided to treat myself with web surfing. I searched for Meetup because I was going to one the next morning. Then I learned that Meetup is actually a company, which was acquired by another company called WeWork last year. Then I started to learn what WeWork does. Then I searched for WeWork facilities nearby on Google maps... I definitely got what I wanted: relax. And learned some new things about the industry as a bonus. What makes this story a story is what happened in the afternoon... A couple of my classmates and I visited one of our sponsor companies as planned. We knew it's a startup, but what surprised me was that the place we were going was one of the WeWork facilities from my search results in the morning. ü§£</p>
          <p>#4. A Great Meetup</p>
          <p>After a crazy April, I finally was able to continue attending the only meetup that I can attend - Seattle CoffeeOps (Dev+Ops) at Chef Software, Inc. The topics were great this time, and I learned a lot about Cloud and Dev-Ops through the discussion. I shared some of my experiences and opinions on diversity and group work. I got to know many fantastic people and Coda! So I will keep going as long as my schedule allows. Also looking forward to LunchOps. üòã</p>
          <p>Overall, it's been a great work with so many surprises. Looking forward to more from the interview week! üòé</p>

          <h2>I Am Back!</h2>
          <h3>May 5, 2018</h3>
          <p>Since Ada's curriculum is so intense, it's very hard to maintain a site with fresh code journals. I will continue updating my portfolio, but I prabably won't have time for this Code Journal section before the program ends... üòÖ </p>

          <h2>CSS Grid vs. Flexbox</h2>
          <h3>Mar 17, 2018</h3>
          <p>To me, CSS is like a huge black box. There are so many propertie and value pairs available hiding somewhere. So I was kinda frustrated ‚òπÔ∏è at some point and had a strong feeling üò§ again... It's not because CSS is hard. Compared to CS fundamentals and design problems, I know CSS is much easier to understand. It just confuses me, and I don't have the time to get everything clear. So I gave align-content, align-items, justify-content and justify-items ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì during retro.</p>
          <p>I expressed my negative feeling üò† to my husband after dinner. And he was quite excited üòÅ when he heard that. It turned out he was kinda an expert in this area - his previous job was to figure out how to let the browser understand these terms and display the html file properly on the screen. So, with his help, I finally know the difference between align and justify.</p>
          <p>Here is a brief summary: <span class="strong">For Grid, justify is always along the row direction ‚û°Ô∏è, and align is always along the column direction ‚¨áÔ∏è. For Flexbox, justify is along the flow direction, and align is perpendicular to the flow direction.</span></p>
          <p>I am glad I asked for help again for this particular problem. It saved me a lot of time, so that I can make this site much better.üòÑ So the moral of this story is: NEVER GIVE UP! If you get stuck and cannot figure it out yourself, look for help. There are so much supports out there. And you may get surprised how much you can learn from others just by a brief conversation. BTW, Happy St. Patrick's Day! üçÄ </p>

          <h2>We Are Doing It!</h2>
          <h3>Mar 17, 2018</h3>
          <p>This is the official first post of this Journal. The past 1.5 month at Ada was amazing. It wasn't easy, but it's AMAZING. (Forgive my so limited and dry English vocabulary...) I learned a lot, not just about coding, but also the amazing people I got to meet and know here. I have to finish my project first, so I will stop here. I may come back and add more later. But before I forget, I want to say: keep going C9. Summer is coming, and we will start our internship very soon. üòÑ </p>
