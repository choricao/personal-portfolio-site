      <h2>Zheng Cao</h2>
      <h3>A Happy & Proud Adie</h3>
      <p>
        Zheng has been in the US for more than 10 year. She finished her graduate study in Tennessee, did a one-year internship in California, then worked for a short time in Texas. Before Ada, she had been a stay-at-home mom for a couple of years. Because she is so hardworking, she worked as a part-time scientific book translator when she took care of her kids at home. Good and bad things happened along the way. But Zheng is always a lucky person, accompanied by friends all the time, and successfully started a new journey back to the workplace. She wants to thank all those people who have helped her throughout this journey of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zheng attended Ada cohort 9 in 2018. She appreciates all the helps from instructors, staffs, alumni, tutors, and her lovely classmates. She cherishes this wonderful and short experience and will do her best to pass on the mission of Ada. She wishes every Adie complete their program successfully and realize their wish that they make at the beginning of the program.
