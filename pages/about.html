      <h2>Zheng Cao</h2>
      <h3>A Happy & Proud Adie</h3>
      <p>
        Zheng has been in the US for more than 10 year. She finished her graduate study in Tennessee, did a one-year internship in California, then worked for a short time in Texas. Before Ada, she has been a stay-at-home mom for a couple of years. Good things and bad things happened along the way. However, Zheng is always a lucky person, accompanied by people all the way, and successfully started a new journey back to the workplace. She wants to thank all those who have helped her through this journey of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zheng attended Ada cohort 9 in 2018. She appreciates all the helps from instructors, staffs, alumni, tutors, and her lovely classmates. She will cherish this wonderful and short experience and do her best to pass on the mission of Ada. She wishes every Adie complete their program successfully and realize their wish they make at the beginning of the program.
