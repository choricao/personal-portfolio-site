          <h3>Mar 17, 2018</h3>
          <p>To me, CSS is like a huge black box. There are so many propertie and value pairs available hiding somewhere. So I was kinda frustrated ☹️ at some point and had a strong feeling 😤 again... It's not because CSS is hard. Compared to CS fundamentals and design problems, I know CSS is much easier to understand. It just confuses me, and I don't have the time to get everything clear. So I gave align-content, align-items, justify-content and justify-items ❓❓❓ during retro.</p>
          <p>I expressed my negative feeling 😠 to my husband after dinner. And he was quite excited 😁 when he heard that. It turned out he was kinda an expert in this area - his previous job was to figure out how to let the browser understand these terms and display the html file properly on the screen. So, with his help, I finally know the difference between align and justify.</p>
          <p>Here is a brief summary: <span class="strong">For Grid, justify is always along the row direction ➡️, and align is always along the column direction ⬇️. For Flexbox, justify is along the flow direction, and align is perpendicular to the flow direction.</span></p>
          <p>I am glad I asked for help again for this particular problem. It saved me a lot of time, so that I can make this site much better.😄 So the moral of this story is: NEVER GIVE UP! If you get stuck and cannot figure it out yourself, look for help. There are so much supports out there. And you may get surprised how much you can learn from others just by a brief conversation. BTW, Happy St. Patrick's Day! 🍀 </p>
