          <p>This is the official first post of this Journal. The past 1.5 month at Ada was amazing. It wasn't easy, but it's AMAZING. (Forgive my so limited and dry English vocabulary...) I learned a lot, not just about coding, but also the amazing people I got to meet and know here. I have to finish my project first, so I will stop here. I may come back and add more later. But before I forget, I want to say: keep going C9. Summer is coming, and we will start our internship very soon. ðŸ˜„ </p>
          <p><strong>Update (May 5, 2018)</strong> : I AM BACK!! Since Ada's curriculum is so intense, it's very hard to maintain a site with fresh code journals. I will continue updating my portfolio, but I prabably won't have time for this Code Journal section before the program ends... ðŸ˜… </p>
